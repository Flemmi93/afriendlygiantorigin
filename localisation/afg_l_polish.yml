The strength of our society and the vision of the Diamonds will guide us to a prosperous future, so long as all do as they are meant for since their emergence. It is this that allowed us to escape our Homeworld, and harness the off-world resources in our own system.\n\nThe time has come now to look to the stars, and find other worlds that we may inhabit and create future generations of Gems. Any organics or other alien foes will fall before our new empire, and we shall easily crush the lower forms of life who dare to oppose our shining greatness!"
